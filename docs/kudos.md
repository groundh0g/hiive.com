## Andrew Rollings

Andrew Rollings has written several books, all connected in some way or other with his love of games. The most notable of these being Game Architecture and Design, which has been the reference for many college and secondary education courses.

Andrew is an ex-UK resident who currently lives in a bunker located in places unknown. He earns his keep by architecting and developing software for companies that span a wide variety of fields. In his spare time, you may see him working on his Nintendo 3DS, Switch, or PC games.

 Andrew has been in the business long enough to know what are good system designs and what are not. Andrew made his mark on the system by analysing and remodelling a major cross cutting concern of the risk server. To this day I have not met a consultant so knowledgeable on the interaction of COM with .NET. He was a pleasure to work with and I will be sad if I do not get a chance to work with him again.

Andrew Rollings is a very skilled developer with amazing troubleshooting skills. He is capable of working in a wide variety of technologies, on a wide variety of platforms. 
 
I first met Andrew when I interviewed him for a project that my team was working on. He was one of only two folks, out of the dozens of programmers that I interviewed, that really impressed me. Before I ever met him, I had a strange feeling that the name on his resume looked very familiar. I soon realized that he was the author of one of my favorite books in my game development library -- Game Architecture and Design. 
 
Andrew did some impressive work on the banking project, and he was instrumental in pulling it from the brink of disaster on more than one occasion. Since our time together at the bank, Andrew has continued to impress me with his programming prowess. 
 
I am grateful for the opportunity to have met and worked with him, and I feel privileged to call him my friend.

Andrew was the first team member of the Regions "Chart the Course" project with whom I worked closely. His ability to macro view the program and provide solution ideas allowed everyone involved to code, clean and debug their assignments quickly and efficiently. I would highly recommend him as a Senior Program Designer or Technical Lead on any programming endeavor.
